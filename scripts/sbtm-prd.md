# Product Requirements Document: Session-Based Test Management Tool

## Introduction/Overview

The Session-Based Test Management (SBTM) Tool is a web application designed to support the creation, editing, and management of test session reports. The tool addresses current pain points in testing workflows including manual tracking, scattered information, and lack of visibility into testing activities. 

SBTM organizes testing into "sessions" - blocks of uninterrupted time during which a tester performs testing work. These sessions are documented in session reports that capture the testing story while providing management with necessary visibility without micromanaging the testing process.

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive web-based tool that minimizes overhead for tracking test sessions, provides flexibility for different SBTM variants, and serves the needs of testers, test leads, and middle management.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Administrative Overhead:** Minimize time spent on session tracking and reporting
2. **Improve Visibility:** Provide clear insights into testing activities for management
3. **Maintain Testing Flexibility:** Preserve analytical and creative freedom for testers
4. **Centralize Information:** Eliminate scattered testing documentation
5. **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide normalized TBS metrics and analytics
6. **Support Multiple Projects:** Allow complete control over settings and templates per project

## User Stories

**As a Tester:**
- I want to quickly create a session from a charter template so that I can start testing without administrative delays
- I want to edit my session notes in a distraction-free environment so that I can focus on documenting findings
- I want to track my time allocation (TBS metrics) so that I can analyze my testing efficiency
- I want auto-save functionality so that I don't lose my work if something unexpected happens

**As a Test Lead:**
- I want to view all team sessions and their status so that I can track testing progress
- I want to create and organize charter templates so that testers have clear mission statements
- I want to filter and search sessions by various criteria so that I can quickly find specific information
- I want to export session data so that I can create reports for stakeholders

**As a Manager:**
- I want to view normalized TBS statistics across the team so that I can understand testing productivity
- I want to see testing growth over time so that I can track team performance trends
- I want to export statistics to CSV so that I can incorporate data into executive reports
- I want read-only access to ensure I can monitor without interfering with testing activities

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Issue/Bug Tracking System:** This tool will reference external issue and bug reports but will not replace dedicated bug tracking systems
- **Test Case Management:** This tool focuses on session-based testing, not traditional test case execution
- **Test Automation Integration:** Initial version will not integrate with automated testing frameworks
- **Advanced Project Management:** This tool will not replace project management software for broader project tracking
- **User Account Management:** The system will not include comprehensive user onboarding, password reset, or profile management beyond basic authentication
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Initial version will not support simultaneous editing by multiple users
- **Mobile Application:** Initial version will be web-only, not a dedicated mobile app
- **Advanced Reporting:** Complex custom report builders are out of scope for MVP

## Design Considerations

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Angular with TypeScript
- Backend: Python
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Responsive web design that works on desktop and tablet devices
- Clean, minimalist interface that reduces distractions during testing
- Floating/modal windows for notes editing to maximize screen real estate

- Session List View: Overview of all sessions with filtering and search
- Charter View: Management of charter templates and organization
- Statistics Dashboard: Visual analytics and reporting interface
- Repository Views: Management interfaces for testers, products, environments, tags, and documents

## Technical Considerations

**Database Design:**
- Implement proper foreign key relationships between all repositories
- Use PostgreSQL JSON columns for flexible metadata storage
- Design for efficient querying of hierarchical tag structures
- Implement soft deletes to maintain data integrity

**Performance Requirements:**
- Page load times should be under 2 seconds
- Search results should return within 1 second
- Auto-save should occur every 30 seconds without blocking user input
- Support concurrent users up to 100 simultaneous sessions

**Security:**
- Implement role-based access control
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Validate all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

**Integration Points:**
- Export APIs for JSON, XML, CSV, and mind map formats
- Import APIs for tags and templates
- Consider future integration hooks for external bug tracking systems

## Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- **Time Savings:** Reduce session report creation time by 50% compared to manual methods
- **Adoption Rate:** Achieve 80% active usage by testers within 3 months of deployment
- **Data Completeness:** Increase complete session reports (all required fields filled) to 90%

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Management Visibility:** Enable 100% of test leads to access real-time testing status
- **Search Efficiency:** Users can find specific sessions within 30 seconds
- **Export Usage:** 70% of test leads use export functionality monthly for reporting

**User Satisfaction Metrics:**
- User satisfaction score of 4.0+ out of 5.0
- Less than 5% of sessions require manual correction after initial entry
- Zero critical bugs in production after first month

## Open Questions

1. **Concurrent Editing:** How should the system handle conflicts when multiple users attempt to edit related data (e.g., charter templates being used in active sessions)?

2. **Data Retention:** What are the requirements for archiving old projects and sessions? How long should revision history be maintained?

3. **Performance Scale:** What is the expected maximum number of sessions per project and total number of projects the system should support?

4. **Integration Priority:** Which external systems (if any) should be prioritized for future integration phases?

5. **Offline Capability:** Should future versions support offline editing with synchronization when connectivity returns?

6. **Advanced Analytics:** What additional statistical analyses or visualizations would be most valuable for management reporting?

7. **Custom Fields:** Should the system support project-specific custom fields for sessions, or is the defined schema sufficient?

8. **Backup and Recovery:** What are the specific requirements for data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity?

## MVP Feature Prioritization

To be determined collaboratively with stakeholders. Suggested approach: prioritize core session creation, editing, and basic reporting functionality for MVP, with advanced analytics and export features in subsequent releases.
